          <h2>Michelle Snyder,Stylist</h2>
          <p>
            Michelle’s skill and vision are in demand across the country. But
            the first recipient of the San Francisco native’s coveted cuts was
            her little sister, whose hair a 12-year-old Michelle would
            practice on, having already bobbed every Barbie in the house.
            Their mom, a stylist herself in the 1960s, was Michelle’s first
            inspiration to pursue a career in hair and her first teacher.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her professional training began under the tutelage of Marcy Harmon
            at the beloved San Francisco salon Cowboys and Angels, where she
            was schooled in both classic Vidal Sassoon technique and modern
            razor-cutting. Michelle continued learning advanced cutting and
            styling techniques at Bumble and bumble in New York. She cemented
            her success as a stylist there as she built a steady clientele of
            celebrities and began working for magazines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Michelle’s celebrity clients include Amanda Peet, Zooey Deschanel,
            Karen Elson, Emily Mortimer, Sienna Miller and Zoe Kravitz. Her
            work has appeared in Dazed & Confused, Vogue, Nylon, Elle, Lula
            and Oyster magazines. Michelle is also the lead stylist for the
            celebrated Vaudevillian-style cabaret performers The Citizens
            Band.
          </p>
          <p>
            Deriving inspiration from old movies, her peers, and a host of
            icons such as Louise Brooks, Jane Birkin, Veruschka von Lehndorff
            and Linda Evangelista, Michelle is making an indelible mark on the
            hair world.

            <h2>Myles Ashman, Stylist</h2>
            <p>
              Growing up in Southern California in the 80’s & 90’s Myles was
              influenced by the effortless, salt-filled hair happening around
              skate and surf culture, and the chaotic energy of punk. He has
              called San Francisco home for over 25 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              While always passionate about hair and fashion, Myles started
              his cutting career at Barrow, training under Michelle Snyder,
              Marcy Harmon, Michael Forrey, Alx Nixon and Corinna Hernandez.
              He is inspired by deconstructed shapes and precision cuts, with
              a special love for working with curly and textured hair, and
              utilizes both advanced razor techniques and shears to create
              striking styles.

            <h2>Dakota Jernigan, Colorist</h2>
            <p>
              Dakota’s fascination with hair started at a very young age when
              she got her hands on her mother’s mannequin heads from her time
              at cosmetology school. She continued honing her skills on her
              mother’s hair throughout childhood, as well as her own and any
              willing participant.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dakota is very inspired by color in every sense of the word,
              pulling inspiration from organic tones found in nature to
              vintage and antique photographs, clothing, and art.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dakota coins herself as an intuitive balayage hair painter,
              tailoring each paint to her client, ensuring that it’s unique to
              each individual. Consistency, softness, and natural color are
              her main focus. She loves knowing each balayage she paints
              exists for only a time, never to be replicated, but to change
              naturally with the help of sunlight and haircutting. She’s
              always anticipating the next paint to morph into something
              beautifully different than the last.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dakota refined her skills for hair color while studying under
              Bekie Raynard, Eileen McCarthy, Marcy Harmon, and Ashley Rourke.
              While building her passion for color at Barrow she also had the
              opportunity to polish her styling skills with the guidance of
              Michelle Snyder.
